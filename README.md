# Chip8
Chip-8 interpreter.

This implementation has a fully functioning CPU passing all test cases outlined in https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite. The program simply outputs the display to the terminal window. As this is a proof-of-concept project, the interpreter does not implement keyboard functionality.
